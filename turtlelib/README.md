# Turtlelib Library
A library for handling transformations in SE(2) and other turtlebot-related math.

# Components
- `rigid2d` - Handles 2D rigid body transformations
- `frame_main` - Perform some rigid body computations based on user input
- `diff_drive` - Class representing a differenttial drive object. Used to keep track the diff drive robot's location
and velocity
- `slam` - Class containing an EKF SLAM object. It keeps track of a robots position relative to the map and has necessary functions to perform EKF SLAM
